abstract: |
  Energy equity is an issue of increasing prevalence. While large datasets exist to analyze household incomes, expenditures, and energy options for households, few consistent metrics exist to evaluate the energy affordability of households. Here, we outline the existing perspectives on energy equity and examine existing models that incorporate incomes, expenditures, and energy options.

# Energy Equity Review

Energy is becoming increasingly unaffordable for American households. In the United States, energy poverty is now a significant challenge as families struggle to meet monthly bills and live paycheck to paycheck[@bednarRecognitionResponseEnergy2020]. Even with rapid declines in technology costs for cleaner, renewable electricity generation options, many households cannot take advantage of technological innovations and advancements such as low-cost rooftop solar or energy efficiency upgrades that improve air quality, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and increase direct household savings[@castellanosRooftopSolarPhotovoltaic2017]. Rooftop solar may be capital intensive, and although the investments may recoup costs, many times a lack of knowledge and experience act as a barrier to implementation. Similarly, for households living in older buildings, the ability to make improvements to building HVAC systems and efficiency changes may require awareness and resources that are left out from current discussions. Renters face systemic disadvantages in the energy transition; they typically pay the energy costs of the home while the landlord controls infrastructure upgrades, leading to a principal agent dilemma.

Universal access to affordable, reliable, and modern energy is one of the core tenets of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7[@pachauriAdvancingEnergyPoverty2020]. Despite efforts to evaluate and quantify energy poverty, few metrics are well-suited to understand the pervasiveness of energy poverty and systematic challenges that many households in the United States face. Access to useful energy is fundamental to ecosystem prosperity and is considered essential to the health and safety of prosperous human civilizations[@hallEnergyWealthNations2018]. The relationship between prosperity and available energy has been explored extensively at macro[@brandtHowDoesEnergy2017] and micro[@mayerTwoFacesEnergy2014] scales across production and consumption stages of the human socio-ecological system's energy life cycle. 

Pachauris & Rao examine this dynamic in the sustainable development context of SDG 7 by comparing a multi-tier framework and a simplified alternative framework for assessing electricity access in Ethiopia, India, and Rwanda[@pachauriAdvancingEnergyPoverty2020]. The multi-tier framework relies on assessments of the durations when energy is available, the quality of voltage supplied, the reliability in terms of number of disruptions, the capacity in terms of Watts available, the consumption levels allowed per day, and affordability of the stanard consumption package as a percentage of household income. These variables are rated in terms of up to five tiers. The simplified alternative framework measures availability as duration of availability, cost of supply depending on the specific context, service level from "minimal" to "affluent", and affordability as a share of the household budget. These frameworks both provide their results in terms of the proportion of the population which is experiencing "minimal", "basic", or "improved" energy access based on national annual survey data used as proxies for the tiers under examination. This method requires many veriables and the ability to normalize amongst different types of data, but it does provide a framework to compare countries that are at different stages of energy system development.

Different groups across society have different basic energy needs[@raoEnergyRequirementsDecent2019]. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that there are multiple standards in the United States: a growing disparity between wealthier and lower-income households, their difference in basic energy needs and extra energy consumption[@brownLowincomeEnergyAffordability2020]. The cost of meeting basic needs is increasingly becoming unaffordable. While per-unit costs are decreasing in the United States, many households struggle to make utility bill payments[@rossHighCostEnergy2018]. This is not just a poverty issue - many of the households living in poverty also lack the agency to perform efficiency upgrades or technology enhancements that could decrease the gap between wealthy and poor households. For instance, although solar electricity has declined in cost dramatically and been heavily incentivised over the 21st century, the upfront capital needed to take advantage of this technology eludes lower-income communities. Efficiency upgrades are similarly capital-intensive. Even though low-interest loans may be available for this purpose in some communities, the bureaucracy and institutional inertia hold back a more rapid transition.

Brown et al. took this query on to ask why does the U.S. have energy poverty in the first place[@brownLowincomeEnergyAffordability2020]? In a thematic exploration of issue's cause and effect, the authors provided a framework to break down energy equity into its constituent components and understand each's root cause. They identify energy access, energy poverty, energy insecurity, and energy burden as key metrics within the energy equity concept (Figure \@ref(fig:equity-framework)), and identify five categories of causes or correlates of high energy burdens in the United States: location & geography, housing characteristics, socio-economic situation, energy prices & policies, and behavioral factors (Figure \@ref(fig:causes-correlates)). While this framework is highly useful as a basis for research, it is conceptual in nature and only backed by empirical evidence to the extent of its sources.

Historically, many attempts have been made to assess household prosperity based on energy metrics[@brownPersistenceHighEnergy2020],[@rossHighCostEnergy2018],[@bednarIntersectionEnergyJustice2017],[@kawaiSpendingHouseholdEnergy2021],[@linAffordabilityAccessFocus2018],[@drehoblUSLowIncomeEnergy2016], though few directly with the intent to understand energy inequity across census tracts and in relation to access and deployment of cleaner energy alternatives. In a paper simultaneous to the aforementioned concept paper, Brown et al. perform a bibliometric analysis of 183 studies of energy burden in the United States[@brownPersistenceHighEnergy2020]. Among a complex web of interconnected attributes (Figure \@ref(fig:network-diagram)) they identify six interconnected themes: energy efficiency, electricity, government programs, climate & energy insecurity, health, and sustainability. Time-of-use load management is identified as a key feature, but no metrics are identified that operate on an hourly timescale. The health implications of energy burden are a hot topic of study, with many researchers focusing on the implications of improved ventilation and weatherization on respiratory health.

Most notably, the United States benchmarks its Federal Poverty Level (FPL) to the food requirements of the average household[@coferFamilyFoodPlans1962] and uses the FPL as an eligibility criterion for more than 40 federal programs across ten agencies (in addition to state, charitable, and private enterprises that also do so)[@divisiondcdProgramsThatUse2015]. Food and energy are interlinked in crises and household energy is a critical part of safe housing, heating, cooling, and cooking. Therefore, energy criteria could expand program access to those underserved populations in need of assistance.

Utilizing such a limited scope of household energy expenditures as food for such a wide array of public policy seems prone to error. The welfare of two households with the same food budget may be drastically different if one prepares the food on modern and efficient electric appliances while the other combusts natural gas in the home, thereby exposing the family members to harmful air pollutants such as particulate matter, NOx, and SOx. By definition, the implications of a limited estimate of poverty used for public policy decisions stretch far beyond direct connections to food. Practitioners have posited that the standard policy of “using the ‘economy food plan’ to determine who can afford to hire an attorney” may be depriving citizens of their basic rights insofar as hiring a lawyer is not the same as purchasing food in almost any respect[@grossTooPoorHire2013].

The United Kingdom has a richer history of incorporating energy burden and energy poverty formally into its government programs. Since 2000, the U.K. has used some form of an energy burden metric to assess whether households are facing energy poverty and determine the level of support that they require as a result. Bednar & Reames review this history in the context of the United States' lack of formalization on this front[@bednarRecognitionResponseEnergy2020]. The U.K. first began its program by identifying any household which spent more than 10% of its income on energy as energy impoverished. While formal recognition of the issue proved useful, the metric itself faced problems in implementation due to its high sensitivity to fuel costs and absolute cutoff level. These critiques led to to the establishment of a "Low Income High Cost" metric which identified a household as energy impoverished if its income was lower than average and its energy costs were higher than average. This solved for issues of absoluteness faced by the ten-percent indicator, but it still faced the limitation that households can move into and out of energy poverty with relative ease due to exogenous forces such as energy market dynamics or climate. Therefore, a Low Income Low Energy Efficiency metric has recently been established, which adds a home efficiency rating to the equation, making it a more absolute measure. If a household's net annual income after energy expenditures and housing costs would be below the poverty line, and the home itself is rated below a C per the national building efficiency scale, then the household is considered to be energy improverished. The addition of a net income measure and the absolute nature of the building efficiency rating promise to improve targeting of aid to those families whose limitations are most directly related to energy.  
    
It stands to reason that a household or community’s prosperity will be broadly related to its energy affordability. The lower the energy burden, the more discretionary income is available to the household for other necessary goods and services, for savings and investments that contribute to economic growth and community well-being. Inversely, high energy burdens constrict households’ participation in society, and contribute broadly to poverty. Researchers have found that gender, age, housing age, tenure type, energy inefficiency, education, employment, geography, socioeconomic status, and race/ethnicity are associated with high energy burdens[@drehoblUSLowIncomeEnergy2016],[@rossHighCostEnergy2018].
    
Ross and Drehobl performed distinct urban[@drehoblUSLowIncomeEnergy2016] and rural[@rossHighCostEnergy2018] analyses of energy burden on behalf of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy to explore this dynamic in United States cities and rural areas. While these are limited by not being traditionally peer-reviewed works, they are cononical texts among energy equity practitioners, and have established the proportion of income spent on energy expenditures as the standard energy burden metric in the United States today. To examine energy burdens in metropolitan areas, the authors used the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)’s American Housing Survey (AHS) data set from 2011 and 2013 to estimate annual incomes and energy expenditures for different demographic groups in the 48 largest metropolian statistical areas in the United States. The demographic groups chosen were low-income, low-income multi-family, African American, Latino, and renters due to each's history of being disproportionately impacted by environmental and housing issues. While this makes sense, the geographic and demographic limitations of this study preclude broader conclusions from being drawn about the dynamics of energy burden in America. Therefore, the authors set out to perform another analysis of rural areas using similar methods and 2015 data to explore how energy burden varies among housing types, housing tenure, race, age, and incomes. While this is a step forward, the distinction between rural and urban households perpetuates a divide in American culture that may not exist in regard to energy burdens. These two studies are severly limited by their geographic scope and the attributes they choose to examine about American communities from the start of each analysis. The Department of Energy significantly improved upon the methodology used by Ross and Drehobl in creating its Low-Income Energy Affordability Dataset (LEAD) in 2016, expanding this analytical tool nationwide at a census tract scale by utilizing the American Community Survey instead. This dataset has not been examined in the same level of detail as Ross and Drehobl's work regarding energy burdens, but it does provide the opportunity to do so.

Even if one were to discount the direct adverse effects for those households experiencing high energy burdens, the societal cost of placing excessive negative pressures on these groups may be high[@brownLowincomeEnergyAffordability2020]. Unaffordable energy has been shown to be negatively related to social cohesion, climate change responses, and disproportionate environmental impacts on low-income populations and minority groups [@carleyJusticeEquityImplications2020]. These connections could have significant implications for navigating sustainable development and meeting societal goals around decarbonization and energy use.

Conversely, we seem to be at a potential inflection point for the promotion of equitable energy prosperity. Primarily this is due to the rapid cost decline and technological improvements in modular digital components for households (solar photovoltaics, battery storage, light-emitting diodes, heat pumps, cooking surfaces, and information technology). The energy system has little history of individual ownership of its assets or competition at the grid edge[@waraCompetitionGridEdge2016]. It is now possible to provide most of the necessary energy services to a household at a lower cost than the existing electric grid by assembling a technology stack with approximately the same size and cost of ownership as a motor vehicle from a combination of solar photovoltaic panels and chemical battery storage. This opportunity is not available equally to everyone. Lower-income households are at risk of paying more for energy if those ablest to pay the cost of defection from the existing grid do so[@barboseBenefitsCostsUtilityownership2020]. We need to understand the dynamics of energy burden and whether we face an opportunity to alleviate it.

Energy affordability has received increased attention especially over the past decade, creating an opportunity to develop a set of widely accepted metrics that can suitably describe all of these dimensions[@linDoesEnergyPoverty2020]. Expanding quantitative analysis in this area can offer additional context, including the use of ratios to identify populations that could be particularly vulnerable to energy shocks or absolute energy burdens. Developing such metrics can elucidate the scale on which American households must save for energy consumption. Frequently used metrics in this category do not tell the whole story. For instance, the simple proportion of a household’s income spent on energy bills (a.k.a. energy burden) does not capture the underlying monthly cash flow patterns that may stress household budgets. More significantly, a simple proportion does not account for the fact that money spent on energy cannot be spent elsewhere, and is therefore not useful income to the household for the purposes of measuring prosperity. Including gross income in the energy burden metric has the effect of depressing the average energy burden, by definition. Furthermore, because energy expenditures are a small proportion of even the most impoverished households' total income, energy burdens are almost always very small percentages (<10%). This leads to issues with interpretability in public discourse and policy settings, and may even affect program outcomes that are based on this metric if these small numbers are rounded to even the nearest hundreth of a percent.  If the household is above an energy poverty line defined by such a metric for public policy purposes, the family may not receive critical support. Because such a small proportion of expenditures can impact different income groups so differently, ratios of this type can be a useful metric when separating across income quantiles or other categories - particularly for vulnerable populations where the absolute energy burden poses a significant difficulty or affordability threshold. However, energy burden is typically portrayed at a population-scale (e.g. the average energy burden of the population is X%). Finally, presenting the relationship between household income and energy expenditures as a proportion with income in the denominator suggests that improvements can only be made by decreasing energy expenditures or increasing incomes. However, in reality there is a positive relationship between energy expenditures and incomes because energy is an input in wealth creating processes and the unit costs of energy decrease as absolute consumption increases. Therefore, stakeholders relying solely on energy burden have limited knowledge of which historical interventions have effectively promoted the energy system's success, and a likewise limited ability to design new interventions to promote community growth and address inequity in the energy system.

Net energy analysis (NEA) offers potential support to the understanding of energy poverty through the use of formally defined Energy Return Ratios (ERR's) that articulate the relationship between the energy flows within complex systems[@carbajales-daleBetterCurrencyInvesting2014]. The implications of numerous metrics of systems-scale efficiency and net energy returns have been explored through this lens to date[@brandtGeneralMathematicalFramework2011], and are recommended as a framework for future analysis[@carbajales-daleBetterCurrencyInvesting2014]. The primary insight that this research adds to the energy burden conversation is to treat the income remaining after energy expenditures (i.e. net income) as the focus of analysis because net income is meaningful to the household and failing to account for it will lead to double-counting of energy expenditures. Another insight is that net income is the result of the use of energy by the household, not the other way around. In other words, households pay for energy expenditures in order to unlock the value that energy services provide to them as participants in society, whether to cook food or connect to the internet. Therefore, the efficiency of a process like household wealth creation is best articulated by placing net income in the numerator of the metric. A final significant insight from net energy analysis that might be incorporated into future work is that embodied energy takes many forms across the household budget (food, goods, services, housing, etc.), and these can all be compared using the same units of measure (e.g. joules).

Finally, further research coalesces around an emerging interdisciplinary interrogation of energy through “macro-energy systems analysis", a class of systems defined by their scale, complexity, and particular suitability for net energy analysis[@leviMacroEnergySystemsNew2019]. Research associated with this macro-energy systems scale examines the net energy dynamics of communities, such as networks of homes connected by a shared electricity grid or geographic boundaries, yet does not explore the energy poverty dimensions through this lens. Nevertheless, different communities in the United States are experiencing energy poverty in different ways. Net energy analysis can be applied as a way to identify energy poverty and determine whether increasing household burdens are going to energy expenditures. This could suggest that the technology-level cost reductions occuring in energy system development are not necessarily accruing to everyday consumers.

The relationship between energy spending and household income in America has been examined at different scales to date, with particular emphasis on how disparate household net energy ratios signal economic disparities across communities, racial and ethnic groups, and levels of income. While there are numerous approaches to assessing energy affordability, a gap in the current discussion over energy equity exists. There is no appropriate biophysical framework to evaluate the disparities among household net energy outcomes, and no analysis of the entire country at a granular geographic scale.
