  abstract = {The rapid growth of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems can pose a number of financial challenges for electric utility shareholders and their customers. One potential pathway to resolving these perceived challenges involves allowing utilities to own and operate rooftop solar systems. However, the financial benefits and costs of this business model are not well understood. Here we model the financial performance of a large-scale utility-owned residential rooftop solar programme. Over a 20\,yr period, the programme increases shareholder earnings by 2\textendash 5\% relative to a no-solar scenario, compared to a 2\% earnings loss when an equivalent amount of rooftop solar is instead owned by non-utility parties. Such a programme could therefore be attractive from the perspective of utility investors. The impacts on utility customers, however, are more mixed, with average bills of non-solar customers increasing by 1\textendash 3\% compared to the no-solar scenario, similar to the 2\% increase under traditional, non-utility-ownership structures.},

  abstract = {Residential energy conservation and efficiency programs are strategic interventions to reduce consumption and increase affordability. However, the inability to identify and distinguish between high energy consumers and highly energy inefficient households has led to ineffective program targeting. Additionally, little is known about the spatial, racial and socioeconomic patterns of urban residential energy consumption and efficiency. Publicly available data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration and the U.S. Census Bureau are used with bottom-up modeling and small-area estimation techniques to predict mean annual heating consumption and energy use intensity (EUI), an energy efficiency proxy, at the census block group level in Detroit (Wayne County), Michigan. Using geographic information systems, results illustrate spatial disparities in energy consumption and EUI. Bivariate analysis show no statistical relationship between race/ethnicity and energy consumption; however, EUI is correlated with racial/ethnic makeup; percent White (-0.28), African American (0.24) and Hispanic (0.16). Income and housing tenure reveal inverse relationships with consumption and efficiency. Though areas with higher median incomes and homeownership exhibited higher consumption (0.28 and 0.56, respectively), they had lower EUIs (-0.48 and -0.38, respectively). This study provides evidence supporting approaches for conservation and energy efficiency program targeting that recognizes the significance of race, ethnicity, place and class.},

  abstract = {With energy transition setting the ground for innovation and new ways of conducting business, onestop shops (OSSs) have recently gained momentum in the renovation market. By transforming a complex set of multiple-actor decisions into a single entry and customer-centric service, OSSs have the potential of establishing a bridge between the fragmented demand and supply sides of the traditional renovation value chain. To assess the viability of the OSSs model as a vehicle of accelerating decarbonisation efforts in the European building stock, this paper collects and analyses 63 case studies of OSSs across Europe. The study offers insights into the dynamics of their business model, key benefits and ways forward, by explicitly exploring OSSs' role in incentivising homeowners to decide to renovate. Our findings show that OSSs can be instrumental in addressing the multitude of barriers that prevent homeowners to renovate. With around 100,000 OSSs projects per year, their activity is expected to substantially contribute to the European renovation targets to rise, subject to favourable policy framework, availability of affordable financing solutions and experience sharing within and across countries. With some OSSs already supporting vulnerable households to renovate, OSSs might be well-placed in the future to contribute to tackle energy poverty by assisting in accessing financing and engaging property owners to renovate.},

In particular, low income tenants face a phenomenon of energy poverty in which they allocate significantly more of their household income to energy expenditures than other renters. This problem is substantial, affecting 1.89\% of all United States' energy use. If effectively addressed, it would create a range of savings between 4 and 11 billion dollars per year for many of the nation's poorest residents. We argue that a carefully designed program of incentives for participants (including landlords) in conjunction with a unique type of utility-managed on-bill financing mechanism has significant potential to solve many of the complications. We focus on three kinds of split incentives, five concerns inherent to addressing split incentive problems (scale, endurance, incentives, savings, political disfavor), and provide a detailed policy proposal designed to surpass those problems, with a particular focus on low-income tenants in a U.S. context.},

We provide a methodology for the simple, straightforward identification of peer effects with sufficiently rich data, avoiding the biases that occur with traditional fixed effects estimation when using the past installed base of consumers in the reference group. We study the diffusion of solar photovoltaic panels in California and find that at the average number of owner-occupied homes in a zip code, an additional installation increases the probability of an adoption in the zip code by 0.78 percentage points. Our results provide valuable guidance to marketers designing strategies to increase referrals and reduce customer acquisition costs.

This paper describes a ``bottom-up'' mathematical formulation which uses matrix-based computations adapted from the LCA (life cycle assessment) literature. The framework allows multiple energy pathways and flexible inclusion of non-energy sectors. This framework is then used to define a variety of ERRs that measure the amount of energy supplied by an energy extraction and processing pathway compared to the amount of energy consumed in producing the energy. ERRs that were previously defined in the literature are cast in our framework for calculation and comparison. For illustration, our framework is applied to include oil production and processing and generation of electricity from PV (photovoltaic) systems. Results show that ERR values will decline as system boundaries expand to include more processes. NERs (net energy return ratios) tend to be lower than GERs (gross energy return ratios). External energy return ratios (such as net external energy return, or NEER (net external energy ratio)) tend to be higher than their equivalent total energy return ratios.},

A lack of a general mathematical framework prevents inter-comparison of NER/EROI estimates between authors: methods used are not standardized, nor is there a framework for succinctly reporting results in a consistent fashion. In this paper we derive normalized mathematical forms of four ERRs for energy extraction and conversion pathways. A bottom-up (process model) formulation is developed for an n-stage energy harvesting and conversion pathway with various system boundaries. Formations with the broadest system boundaries use insights from life cycle analysis to suggest a hybrid process model/economic input output based framework. These models include indirect energy consumption due to external energy inputs and embodied energy in materials. Illustrative example results are given for simple energy extraction and conversion pathways. Lastly, we discuss the limitations of this approach and the intersection of this methodology with ``top-down'' economic approaches.},

  abstract = {It has been proposed that energy resource depletion and declining energy return on investment (EROI) can disrupt modern, prosperous lifestyles. This is because such lifestyles are dependent on abundant, lowcost energy supplies, to date supplied by fossil energy. We illustrate a mathematical structure by which to analyze the impacts of energy depletion as it affects all sectors of the economy. This framework is based on the reduced availability of discretionary outputs as inter-industry operations become less efficient. We illustrate this mathematical framework, and explore a simple template economy with four sectors. The inputs for each sector are defined at an order-of-magnitude level using data for the US, and the matrix is modified to explore the impacts of resource depletion and uncertainty. We show that the ``net energy cliff'' concept used in prior studies emerges from the structure of this template economy and appears at similar levels of energy productivity hypothesized in prior work. At levels of net energy return {$\leq$} 5 J/J, the fraction of productive outputs free to use in discretionary purposes declines rapidly, resulting in the emergence of an effective ``minimum EROI'' below which prosperity is burdened by excessive direct and indirect requirements of the energy sector. We explore how uncertainty in the matrix specification impacts the level at which the minimum EROI becomes binding. We also show how changes in other sectors (e.g., efficiency of materials production) can affect the rate at which energy depletion affects prosperity.},

After decades of weatherization and bill-payment programs, low-income households still spend a higher percent of their income on electricity and gas bills than any other income group. Their energy burden is not declining, and it remains persistently high in particular geographies such as the South, rural America, and minority communities. As public agencies and utilities attempt to transition to a sustainable energy future, many of the programs that promote energy efficiency, rooftop solar, electric vehicles, and home batteries are largely inaccessible to low-income households due to affordability barriers. This review describes the ecosystem of stakeholders and programs, and identifies promising opportunities to address low-income energy affordability, such as behavioral economics, data analytics, and leveraging health care benefits.

In this study, we identified the impacts of reduced mobility on pollutants and emissions, the emergence of nationalist approaches and effects on international cooperation, and how these issues will affect the achievement of global carbon targets and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). COVID-19 presents a global short-term crisis and there is a demonstrated global desire and effort to develop a vaccine and effective treatments. Similarly, climate change is also a near future issue, and as a result we need to reduce CO2 emissions rapidly.

  abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in stay-at-home policies and other social distancing behaviors in the United States in spring of 2020. This paper examines the impact that these actions had on emissions and expected health effects through reduced personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption. Using daily cell phone mobility data for each U.S. county, we find that vehicle travel dropped about 40\% by mid-April across the nation. States that imposed stay-at-home policies before March 28 decreased travel slightly more than other states, but travel in all states decreased significantly. Using data on hourly electricity consumption by electricity region (e.g., balancing authority), we find that electricity consumption fell about six percent on average by mid-April with substantial heterogeneity. Given these decreases in travel and electricity use, we estimate the county-level expected improvements in air quality, and therefore expected declines in mortality. Overall, we estimate that, for a month of social distancing, the expected premature deaths due to air pollution from personal vehicle travel and electricity consumption declined by approximately 360 deaths, or about 25\% of the baseline 1500 deaths. In addition, we estimate that CO2 emissions from these sources fell by 46 million metric tons (a reduction of approximately 19\%) over the same time frame.},

Many welf\textasciitilde re agencies use the USDA food plans as a basis for estimating money allotments for food, and in part, for determining the ability of families to pay for social services. Social workers, lawyers, and judges often use the cost of food for the plans as a base for setting foster care and dependency fees. The plans are used extensively by home economists, nutrition teachers, home demonstration agents, and others who are counseling families at all income levels. Farm families find the plans helpful as a guide for planning food production and preservation. Economists use them in estimating potential demand for agricultpral products. This publication brings up to date and extends the information in "Helping Families Plan Food Budgets," U.S. Department of Agriculture Miscellaneous Publication No. 662. The report is divided into three parts. Part I describes food plans at different cost levels and shows how they can be used in figuring food requirements for families. Part II gives the history of food budgets and provides background information on the procedures used in developing the current food plans for those interested in the basic construction of the plans and the estimation of nutritive values. Part III presents the method followed in estimating the cost of the food included in each plan, together with suggestions for adapting the procedure for use with local food prices},

We introduce a novel method for calculating energy-limiting behavior in lowincome households using a residential electricity consumption dataset. We first determine the outdoor temperature at which households start using cooling systems, the inflection temperature. Our energy poverty metric, the energy equity gap, is defined as the difference in the inflection temperatures between low and high-income groups. In our study region, we estimate the energy equity gap to be between 4.7\textdegree F and 7.5\textdegree F. In 2015-2016, within our sample of 4,577 households, we found 86 energypoor and 214 energy-insecure households. In contrast, the income-based energy burden metric identified 141 households as energy insecure when the threshold was set to 10\%. Only three households overlapped between the energy equity gap and energy burden measures. Thus, the energy equity gap reveals a hidden but complementary aspect of energy poverty.},

At the same time, it has the flexibility to be deployed in a way that is sensitive to local contexts. Understanding energy use in the capabilities space also provides a means for identifying multiple sites of intervention, including some areas that are currently largely overlooked. We argue that this is advantageous for attempts to address energy poverty in the context of climate change and imperatives for the containment of aggregate energy consumption.},

Energy burden is the proportion of total household income used to pay home energy bills, which includes electricity, natural gas, and other heating fuels. We examined energy burdens for select groups\textemdash low-income, low-income multifamily, African American, Latino, and renters\textemdash in 48 of the largest metropolitan areas in the country. We determined that the overwhelming majority of households in these groups experienced energy burdens higher than that of the average household in the same metro area. Low-income households experienced energy burdens three times the burdens of non-low-income households. In order to combat high energy burdens in low-income communities, policymakers can utilize strategies to ramp up energy efficiency programs. We propose four strategies for increasing investment in low-income energy efficiency programs: (1) improve and expand low-income utility programs; (2) collect, track, and report demographic data on program participation; (3) strengthen policy levers and more effectively leverage existing programs; and (4) utilize the Clean Power Plan (CPP) to prioritize investment in low-income energy efficiency. State and local governments and utility program administrators should use this research as a starting point to better understand the extent of high energy burdens in their communities and the policies and programs that can ensure more-sustainable energy costs and a better living environment.},

Previous research has shown that this type of material hardship can lead to negative mental and physical health outcomes, especially for children and the elderly. This study analyzes a state-representative sample of low-income households to evaluate if households of color are more likely than white households to be energy insecure, and, if the reasons are either poor housing conditions or higher energy burdens. We find that energy insecurity is widespread. Over a year period, 30 percent of respondents were unable to pay at least one energy bill, 33 percent received at least one disconnection notice, and 13 percent were disconnected from their electric utility service. Regression analysis further suggests that Black and Hispanic households are more likely than white households to be energy insecure. Additionally, deficient housing conditions and higher energy burdens are both independent predictors of household energy insecurity. Through a mediating variables analysis, however, we find that housing conditions and energy burdens only explain a small proportion of the association between race and energy insecurity. These results indicate that there remains considerable uncertainty about the reasons that households of color experi\- ence energy insecurity at higher rates than white households and that future research is needed to uncover the mechanisms underlying these disparities.},

  abstract = {Economic production and, more generally, most global societies, are overwhelmingly dependant upon depleting supplies of fossil fuels. There is considerable concern amongst resource scientists, if not most economists, as to whether market signals or cost benefit analysis based on today's prices are sufficient to guide our decisions about our energy future. These suspicions and concerns were escalated during the oil price increase from 2005 \textendash{} 2008 and the subsequent but probably related market collapse of 2008. We believe that Energy Return On Investment (EROI) analysis provides a useful approach for examining disadvantages and advantages of different fuels and also offers the possibility to look into the future in ways that markets seem unable to do. The goal of this paper is to review the application of EROI theory to both natural and economic realms, and to assess preliminarily the minimum EROI that a society must attain from its energy exploitation to support continued economic activity and social function. In doing so we calculate herein a basic first attempt at the minimum EROI for current society and some of the consequences when that minimum is approached. The theory of the minimum EROI discussed here, which describes the somewhat obvious but nonetheless important idea that for any being or system to survive or grow it must gain substantially more energy than it uses in obtaining that energy, may be especially important. Thus any particular being or system must abide by a ``Law of Minimum EROI'', which we calculate for both oil and corn-based ethanol as about 3:1 at the mine-mouth/farm-gate. Since most biofuels have EROI's of less than 3:1 they must be subsidized by fossil fuels to be useful.},

Energy efficiency upgrades can potentially reduce energy expenses and improve thermal comfort, while also addressing problematic issues in the home environment. The present mixed method pilot study explored the impacts of energy efficiency upgrades in 20 households in a low-income community in New York City. Surveys and interviews were administered to the heads of household in a variety of housing types. Interviews were also conducted with landlords of buildings that had recently undergone upgrades. Findings indicate that energy efficiency measures resulted in improved thermal comfort, enhanced health and safety and reduced energy costs. Participants reported largely positive experiences with the upgrades, resulting in direct and indirect benefits. However, results also indicate negative consequences associated with the upgrades and further illustrate that weatherization alone was insufficient to address all of the issues facing low-income households. Moreover, qualitative results revealed differing experiences of low-income renters compared to homeowners. Overall, energy efficiency upgrades are a promising intervention to mitigate the energy and structurally related challenges facing low-income households, but larger scale research is needed to capture the long-term implications of these upgrades.},

The inclusion of marginalized populations in this process is important and will require that they have access to charging infrastructure. Public EV charging stations may help reduce the EV adoption barriers affecting these populations. This study combines public charging station location data with American Community Survey data at the census block group level in California, finding that public charger access is lower in block groups with below-median household incomes and in those with a Black and Hispanic majority populations. These public charger access disparities are more pronounced in areas with a higher proportion of multi-unit housing, where they are critical for EV operation due to a lower likelihood of residential charger access. Controlling for distance to the nearest highway or freeway, multi-unit housing unit rate, and median household income, we find that Black and Hispanic majority block groups are the only race and ethnicity group that is significantly less likely to have access to any public charger in their block groups compared to the rest of the state. The odds of having public charger access for the group is 0.7-times that of the no majority reference group. The access gap is even larger for the publicly-funded charging stations where Black and Hispanic majority block groups are approximately half as likely as the no-majority reference group to have access. Hence directing a larger portion of the funding to underserved communities and further government involvement in filling the public charger access gap can be crucial in achieving widespread and equitable EV adoption.},

It uses data from the Energy Information Administration Residential Energy Consumption Surveys (RECS) for the years 1993, 1997, 2001, 2009, and 2015. The calculations are displayed in tables and figures to facilitate exploration of the data in multiple formats and support research and communication on ``energy burdened'' households. ``Energy burdened'' households are defined as those that spend a disproportionate percentage of income on energy. This report does not attempt to define a specific threshold percentage to define energy burden, but provides data and specific calculations at different percentages (up to 10\% of income spent on household energy) to allow readers to discuss what percentage might indicate a harm to livelihood due to income becoming a constraint for paying for proper energy services within a household. The ratio of the total household income spent on energy varies across regions of the U.S., with the Pacific and Mountain regions reporting lower values than the central and eastern regions of the U.S. Possibly due to changes in survey methodologies (sample sizes and assumed income brackets) the 2009 and 2015 RECS show significantly different trends than the other years. The 2009 data indicate higher energy spending (14-20\% of households spending {$>$}10\% of income on household energy), and this could have been a result of lower incomes following the Great Recession. The 2015 data indicate significantly lower energy spending (4-10\% of households spending {$>$}10\% of income on household energy). The survey years 1993, 1997, and 2001 indicate 8-18\% of households spending {$>$}10\% of income on household energy.},

It aims to extend previous research by considering both indoor temperatures from existing housing, and empirical studies that focus on energy efficiency measures and subsequent health impacts. To achieve this aim, a literature review was undertaken, combining engineering and health databases. The review established that, overall, inadequate indoor temperatures are associated with poor health status, whereas energy efficiency measures have been associated to improved indoor temperatures and occupant\&rsquo;s health namely regarding cardiovascular, respiratory and mental health disorders. These health conditions are among the most prevalent non-communicable diseases (NCD). The review also highlighted the need for more empirical studies with an extended timeframe to deal with climate change challenges. It underlined the potential advantages of the convergence between health and energy efficiency studies, for better modelling and planning.},

The analysis of energy poverty is crucial in breaking the illusion of the dilemma between enhancing energy efficiency and controlling poverty. Based on Chinese residential energy consumption survey, we firstly estimated the energy poverty in China by the ``10\% indicator'' and ``LIHC indicators'', and then proposed a ``minimum end-use'' method to classify the energy-poor households into lifeline and consumption energy poverty. Results show that energy poverty exists in China at the proportion of 18.9\%, and 46\% of the energy-poor houses are in short of modern energy consumption and are sensitive to tariffs, with a level of electricity consumption lower than the basic demand. The energy poverty rate is highest in central China, while the lifeline energy poor are relatively concentrated in the western region. In terms of public policy, we suggest focusing on heterogeneity by considering different groups of households when implementing energy efficiency measures, and targeting more on the consumption energy poor in poverty alleviation. We also suggest paying particular attention to targeting households with low income by supporting practices such as coupons for energy consumption and appliance purchasing.},

In this case study, energy demand and expenses for dwelling and transport are modelled at the household level, taking into account technical and localization aspects. Then, data on households' income are included in order to determine the number of fuel poor households at the urban district level.},

Using data from the 2009 Residential Energy Consumption Survey, I present empirical evidence that this underinvestment occurs in multiple categories of residential energy efficiency: space-heating, water-heating, window thickness, insulation, and weatherization. Because these landlords did not invest at the same rate as homeowners and landlords who pay the energy bill, their tenants' energy bill was higher by nearly 2\%. When combined with other researchers' estimations for appliances (Davis, 2010), insulation, and thermostat responsiveness for tenants (Gillingham et al., 2012), our results imply that renters use approximately 2.7\% more energy overall due to the landlord-tenant split incentive issue.},

We show that energy insecurity is highly prevalent among households at or below 200\% of the federal poverty line. We further show that Black and Hispanic households are more likely to experience energy insecurity and face utility disconnection, as are households with young children, individuals that require electronic medical devices and those in dwellings with inefficient or poor conditions. These conditions exist under normal circumstances, and the COVID-19 pandemic seems to have exacerbated the overall incidence of energy insecurity.},

Renewable energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation are all commonly suggested solutions. Both supply- and demand-side interventions will displace energyand emissionsfrom conventional generators. Marginal emissions factors (MEFs) give a consistent metric for assessing the avoided emissions resulting from such interventions. This paper presents the first systematic calculation of MEFs for the U.S. electricity system. Using regressions of hourly generation and emissions data from 2006 through 2011, we estimate regional MEFs for CO2, NOx, and SO2, as well as the share of marginal generation from coal-, gas-, and oil-fired generators. Trends in MEFs with respect to system load, time of day, and month are explored. We compare marginal and average emissions factors (AEFs), finding that AEFs may grossly misestimate the avoided emissions resulting from an intervention. We find significant regional differences in the emissions benefits of avoiding one megawatt-hour of electricity: compared to the West, an equivalent energy efficiency measure in the Midwest is expected to avoid roughly 70\% more CO2, 12 times more SO2, and 3 times more NOx emissions.},

We define households as poor if at least two forms of deprivation are present. We apply our measure to Poland. In 2017, 10\% of households in Poland suffered from multidimensional energy poverty. Households living in buildings built before 1946, households living in rural areas, and households that were dependent on retirement and disability pensions were at the highest risk of multidimensional energy poverty.},

This study details how energy justice can serve as a novel conceptual tool for philosophers and ethicists that better integrates usually distinct distributive and procedural justice concerns. Energy justice serves as an important analytical tool for energy researchers striving to understand how values get built into energy systems or to resolve common energy problems. Energy justice presents a useful decision-making tool that can assist energy planners and consumers in making more informed energy choices. Our energy justice framework has elements of Kantian ethics, which takes each person as an end. It has libertarian elements of freedom and choice, suggesting that good societies present people with a set of opportunities or substantial freedoms, so they can choose to exercise these or not. It is pluralist about value, holding that capabilities for people are different and also that their own interests vary. It is concerned with justice as recognition, noting that failures of procedural justice can result in discrimination and marginalization. It, also, has elements focused on utilitarianism and welfare, attempting to improve the quality of life for all people, as defined by their capabilities.},

  abstract = {German regulations for the thermal renovation of existing homes demand high thermal standards, which the government claims are technically and economically feasible. This paper examines existing data on 3400 German homes; their calculated energy performance ratings (EPR) are then plotted against the actual measured consumption. The results indicate that occupants consume, on average, 30\% less heating energy than the calculated rating. This phenomenon is identified as the `prebound' effect and increases with the calculated rating. The opposite phenomenon, the rebound effect, tends to occur for low-energy dwellings, where occupants consume more than the rating. A similar phenomenon has been recognized in recent Dutch, Belgian, French and UK studies, suggesting policy implications in two directions. Firstly, using a dwelling's energy rating to predict fuel and CO2 savings through retrofits tends to overestimate savings, underestimate the payback time and possibly discourage cost-effective, incremental improvements. Secondly, the potential fuel and CO2 savings through non-technical measures such as occupant behaviour may well be far larger than is generally assumed in policies so policy-makers need a better understanding of what drives or inhibits occupants' decisions.

Ce ph\'enom\`ene est identifi\'e en raison de l'accroissement de l'effet de \guillemotleft{} pr\'e-bond \guillemotright{} avec la classe calcul\'ee. Le ph\'enom\`ene oppos\'e, l'effet de rebond, tend \`a se produire dans les logements \`a basse consommation d'\'energie, dans lesquels les occupants ont une consommation sup\'erieure \`a la classe. Un ph\'enom\`ene similaire a \'et\'e reconnu dans des \'etudes r\'ecentes n\'eerlandaises, belges, fran\c{c}aises et britanniques, sugg\'erant des implications en termes de politiques dans deux directions. En premier lieu, l'utilisation de la classe \'energ\'etique d'un logement pour pr\'evoir les \'economies de combustible et de CO2 pouvant \^etre obtenues gr\^ace \`a des r\'enovations a tendance \`a surestimer les \'economies, \`a sous-estimer le d\'elai d'amortissement et \'eventuellement \`a dissuader d'effectuer des am\'eliorations incr\'ementielles rentables. En second lieu, les \'economies potentielles de combustible et de CO2 pouvant \^etre obtenues par des mesures non techniques telles que le comportement des occupants peuvent se r\'ev\'eler \^etre bien plus importantes que cela n'est suppos\'e en r\`egle g\'en\'erale dans les politiques, de sorte que les d\'ecideurs ont besoin de mieux comprendre ce qui motive ou emp\^eche les d\'ecisions des occupants.

  abstract = {We characterize regionally specific life cycle CO2 emissions per mile traveled for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs) across the United States under alternative assumptions for regional electricity emission factors, regional boundaries, and charging schemes. We find that estimates based on marginal vs average grid emission factors differ by as much as 50\% (using National Electricity Reliability Commission (NERC) regional boundaries). Use of state boundaries versus NERC region boundaries results in estimates that differ by as much as 120\% for the same location (using average emission factors). We argue that consumption-based marginal emission factors are conceptually appropriate for evaluating the emissions implications of policies that increase electric vehicle sales or use in a region. We also examine generation-based marginal emission factors to assess robustness. Using these two estimates of NERC region marginal emission factors, we find the following: (1) delayed charging (i.e., starting at midnight) leads to higher emissions in most cases due largely to increased coal in the marginal generation mix at night; (2) the Chevrolet Volt has higher expected life cycle emissions than the Toyota Prius hybrid electric vehicle (the most efficient U.S. gasoline vehicle) across the U.S. in nearly all scenarios; (3) the Nissan Leaf BEV has lower life cycle emissions than the Prius in the western U.S. and in Texas, but the Prius has lower emissions in the northern Midwest regardless of assumed charging scheme and marginal emissions estimation method; (4) in other regions the lowest emitting vehicle depends on charge timing and emission factor estimation assumptions.},

The second part applies the model developed in part one to simulate the direct and indirect rebound for the average U.S. household in terms of primary energy, CO2e, NOx, and SO2 emissions and for energy efficiency investments in electricity, natural gas, or gasoline services. Part one provides a critical review of the largely independent economic and industrial ecology literatures on the indirect rebound. By studying the two-goods case and the n-goods case, we demonstrate that the indirect rebound is bounded by the consumer budget constraint, and inversely related to the direct rebound. We also compare the common proportional spending and income elasticity spending assumptions with our model of cross-price elasticities including both substitution and income effects for the indirect rebound. By assuming zero incremental capital costs and the same embodied energy as conventional technologies for efficient appliances, we model an upper bound of the indirect rebound. Future work should also consider the increase in consumer welfare possible through the rebound effect.},

  abstract = {Cities seek nuanced understanding of intraurban inequality in energy use, addressing both income and race, to inform equitable investment in climate actions. However, nationwide energy consumption surveys are limited ({$<$}6,000 samples in the United States), and utility-provided data are highly aggregated. Limited prior analyses suggest disparity in energy use intensity (EUI) by income is {$\sim$}25\%, while racial disparities are not quantified nor unpacked from income. This paper, using new empirical fine spatial scale data covering all 200,000 households in two US cities, along with separating temperature-sensitive EUI, reveals intraurban EUI disparities up to a factor of five greater than previously known. We find 1) annual EUI disparity ratios of 1.27 and 1.66, comparing lowest- versus highest-income block groups (i.e., 27 and 66\% higher), while previous literature indicated only {$\sim$}25\% difference; 2) a racial effect distinct from income, wherein non-White block groups (highest quintile non-White percentage) in the lowest-income stratum reported up to a further {$\sim$}40\% higher annual EUI than less diverse block groups, providing an empirical estimate of racial disparities; 3) separating temperature-sensitive EUI unmasked larger disparities, with heating\textendash cooling electricity EUI of lowest-income block groups up to 2.67 times (167\% greater) that of highest income, and high racial disparity within lowest-income strata wherein high non-White ({$>$}75\%) population block groups report EUI up to 2.56 times (156\% larger) that of majority White block groups; and 4) spatial scales of data aggregation impact inequality measures. Quadrant analyses are developed to guide spatial prioritization of energy investment for carbon mitigation and equity. These methods are potentially translatable to other cities and utilities.},

It also analyses the implications of energy communities as new actors for consumers and the energy system. The analysis draws evidence from literature review and 24 case studies of community energy projects as described in the Annex. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has previously expressed interest in the concept of collective energy actions. A 2018 paper analyses projects from the JRC smart grids database that present a community-oriented approach (Marinopoulos, Vasiljevska, and Mengolini, 2018). Another paper explored the use of blockchain in energy communities (Kounelis et al., 2017). The current report continue this work by delving into the analysis of community energy projects that could be potentially considered energy communities.},

  abstract = {We estimate the lifetime magnitude and distribution of the private and public benefits and costs of currently installed distributed solar PV systems in the United States. Using data for recentlyinstalled systems, we estimate the balance of benefits and costs associated with installing a nonutility solar PV system today. We also study the geographical distribution of the various subsidies that are made available to owners of rooftop solar PV systems, and compare it to distributions of population and income. We find that, after accounting for federal subsidies and local rebates and assuming a discount rate of 7\%, the private benefits of new installations will exceed private costs only in seven of the 19 states for which we have data and only if customers can sell excess power to the electric grid at the retail price. These states are characterized by abundant sunshine (California, Texas and Nevada) or by high electricity prices (New York). Public benefits from reduced air pollution and climate change impact exceed the costs of the various subsidies offered system owners for less than 10\% of the systems installed, even assuming a 2\% discount rate. Subsidies flowed disproportionately to counties with higher median incomes in 2006. In 2014, the distribution of subsidies was closer to that of population income, but subsidies still flowed disproportionately to the better-off. The total, upfront, subsidy per kilowatt of installed capacity has fallen from \$5200 in 2006 to \$1400 in 2014, but the absolute magnitude of subsidy has soared as installed capacity has grown explosively. We see considerable differences in the balance of costs and benefits even within states, indicating that local factors such as system price and solar resource are important, and that policies (e.g. net metering) could be made more efficient by taking local conditions into account.},

Regulating emissions associated with delivered electricity is further complicated by contractual arrangements for dynamic electricity transfers that confound emission accounting approaches rooted in the physics of grid operations. Here, we propose a novel consumption-based accounting methodology to reconcile the nominal and the physical flows of electricity from generators to consumers. We also compare capacity factor-based and regression-based approaches for estimating default emission factors, in the absence of fully specified nominal electricity flows. As a case study, we apply this approach to assess the methods by which California regulators quantify specified and unspecified electricity imports and their associated GHG emissions. Collectively, these efforts illustrate principles for a comprehensive, empirical accounting framework that could inform efforts to improve the accuracy and consistency of policies regulating regional electricity transfers.},

Here I provide a comprehensive assessment of the U.S. electric utility industry's regulatory response to this threat over the past three years. Electric utilities across the United States are asking their Public Utility Commissions for changes in rate structures that, depending on their details, may either reduce cross-subsidies to distributed energy resources or may be erecting much higher barriers to entry for this and other innovative energy technologies and business models. Usually, a utility's actions are exempt from antitrust scrutiny under the State Action Immunity and Filed Rate doctrines. I argue that in the case of the utility response to distributed energy, this may not be the case. Because the risk exists, both electric utilities and their overseeing commissions need to make much greater efforts to evaluate the competitive impacts of changes in rates - a consideration that is largely absent from the proceedings to date. By doing so, they will both ensure that society's interest in a cleaner, more innovative, more productive energy sector is protected and at the same time minimize their own risks of liability under the antitrust statutes.},
