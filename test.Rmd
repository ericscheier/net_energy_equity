abstract: | 
  Energy poverty in the United States is an issue of increasing urgency, exacerbated by rising inequality. Few policy-relevant datasets evaluate the energy burden of typical American households. Here, we develop a framework using net energy analysis and socioeconomic data at the census tract-level to observe systematic energy inequity across the United States among critical groups that heed policy attention.

Substantive edits based on peer-review are [red]{color=`r edit_color`}, with major standalone deletions denoted by [~~red strikethrough~~]{color=`r edit_color`}. Rearrangements of existing text order are not necessarily noted in this document.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

(ref:metric-comparison-fig-cap) Display of the relationship between [E~b~]{color=`r edit_color`} and [N~h~]{color=`r edit_color`} with net income (gross income - energy expenditures) for US households.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='(ref:metric-comparison-fig-cap)'}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
df <- data.frame(Parameter = c("NO\\textsubscript{x} emissions", "SO\\textsubscript{2} emissions", "CO\\textsubscript{2}     emissions"),
                 "Value mg/Nm\\textsuperscript{3}" = c("800\\%",900,1000),
                 check.names = F)

knitr::kable(df,escape = F, caption = 'Example table!',  booktabs = TRUE, format = "latex") %>% #
  row_spec(0, bold = T, color = "white", background = "#045a8d") %>%
  row_spec(c(2), bold = T, color = "white", background = "#3690c0")
```
