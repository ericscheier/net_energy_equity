abstract: | 
  Energy poverty in the United States is an issue of increasing urgency, exacerbated by rising inequality. Few policy-relevant datasets evaluate the energy burden of typical American households. Here, we develop a framework using net energy analysis and socioeconomic data at the census tract-level to observe systematic energy inequity across the United States among critical groups that heed policy attention.

```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
