  # Introduction
  
  Energy burden is a standard indicator of energy affordability and equity.

\[G = Gross\ Income\ ;\ S = Spending\ on\ Energy\]
\[
  Energy\ Burden\ (E_{b})= \frac{S}{G}
  \]

Can we build on the energy burden framework by assessing __*net*__ energy burdens at a macro-energy systems scale? Yes[@scheierMeasurementStrategyAddress2022].

\[
  Household\ Net\ Energy\ Return\ (N_{h}) = \frac{G - S}{S}
  \]

# Methods

Redefine our net energy metric as a percentage to improve understanding:
  
  \[
    Net\ Energy\ Burden\ (E^{n}_{b}) = \frac{S}{G - S}
    \]

Apply the Net Energy Burden ($E_b^n$) framework to estimates of spending and income for the U.S. residential housing stock[@maLowIncomeEnergyAffordability2019] to determine how many homes' __net energy burdens__ lie below a standard energy poverty line of **$E_b^n \approx 6\%$**.

\[E_{B}^{*} = \frac{S}{G} = 6\%\ \Rightarrow \ E^{n*}_{b} \approx 6\%\ ;\ N_{h}^{*} \approx 16\]

# Results

+ **1 in 6** homes in the U.S. faces energy poverty.
+ **1 in 4** homes facing energy poverty is above the US Federal Poverty Line
+ **Solar** powered homes experience energy poverty **50% as often** as other homes
+ Homes in minority communities experience energy poverty **2x as often** as other homes
