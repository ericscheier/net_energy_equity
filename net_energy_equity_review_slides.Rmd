# + 1 in 3 U.S. households report facing a challenge in meeting energy needs
# + 1 in 5 households report reducing or forgoing necessities such as food and medicine to pay an energy bill
# + 1 in 7 reporte receiving a disconnection notice for energy service
# + 1 in 10 report keeping their home at an unhealthy or unsafe temperature

# Previous Analyses

+ Bednar & Reames - compares 3 energy poverty metrics used in UK
+ Petchari et al. - examines more sophisticated metrics in the context of SDG 7
+ Brown et al - Why does the U.S. have energy poverty in the first place?
+ Sergi et. al - How can decarbonization alleviate health and poverty?
+ ACEEE - Performed distinct urban and rural analysis of energy burden

# Energy Burden & Net Energy Return

\[
G_{income} = Gross\ Income
\]

\[
S_{energy} = Spending\ on\ Energy
\]


\[
Energy\ Burden = \frac{S_{energy}}{G_{income}}
\]

\[
NetEnergyReturn_{household} = \frac{G_{income} - S_{energy}}{S_{energy}}
\]

Energy Poverty = 10% or more of income toward energy

```

# Conclusions

+ 10% of households experience energy poverty as presently defined as spending more than 10% of household income on energy expenditures.
+ While 78% of households below the federal poverty line also face energy poverty, fewer than 1% of those above the federal poverty line face this scarcity. 
+ Energy Poverty presents an obstacle to debarbonization and wealth creation

# Conclusions

Energy expenditures in the US disproportionately burden those in:

+ The Black Belt across the Southeastern U.S.
+ Hispanic communities near the U.S.-Mexico border
+ Native American lands
+ Urban Centers

The United States should develop and implement a federal energy poverty line

# Future Research

+ Include additional demographic and techno-economic data found in Renewable Energy Potential of Low-Income Communities in America (REPLICA) Dataset
+ Focus on certain jurisdictions (cities, counties, utilities)
+ Examine unusual outcomes (e.g. 20% of those below poverty line who are not in energy poverty)
+ Formally compare different metrics to identify which are suited for what purposes
