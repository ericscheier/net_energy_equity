# + 1 in 3 U.S. households report facing a challenge in meeting energy needs
# + 1 in 5 households report reducing or forgoing necessities such as food and medicine to pay an energy bill
# + 1 in 7 reporte receiving a disconnection notice for energy service
# + 1 in 10 report keeping their home at an unhealthy or unsafe temperature

# Previous Analyses

+ Pachauris & Rao: development context of SDG 7  
    + Multi-tier framework: duration, quality, reliability, capacity, levels, & affordability
    + Simplified alternative framework: availability, cost, level, & affordability
+ Bednar & Reames: follows UK policy history from 2000  
    + Energy Burden: energy spending > 10% of inome
    + Low Income High Cost: income/cost lower/higher than average
    + Low Income Low Efficiency: added home efficiency rating
+ Brown et al.: Why does the U.S. have energy poverty in the first place?
    + 2020a: bibliometric analysis of 183 papers
    + 2020b: thematic exploration of issue cause and effect
+ ACEEE: Distinct urban and rural analyses of energy burden
    + The High Cost of Energy in Rural America (Ross et al.)
    + The US Low-Income Energy Affordability Landscape (Drehobl and Ross)

# Limitations

+ Require many varaibles / data (e.g. efficiency standards)
+ Mix of energy access, insecurity, poverty, and affordability
+ Focus on highly specific geographies or aggregates
+ Depend on strict cutoffs
+ Annual timescale

# New Data

Low-Income Energy Affordability Data (LEAD)

**Purpose**: "to help state and local partners understand housing and energy characteristics for the low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities they serve"

  + **Source**: U.S. Department of Energy
  + **Method**: Iterative Proportional Fitting (IPF) of responses from the 5-year American Community Survey (ACS-5)
  + **Geography**: Census tracts for 50 states, D.C., & P.R.
  + **Provides**: Incomes and Energy Costs by Housing Characteristics
  + **Years**: 2016, 2018

# Cohort Attributes

+ Census Tract [n=~70,000]
+ Income Bracket (% of AMI or FPL) [5]
+ Housing Tenure (Rent / Own) [2]
+ Building Age (increments of 10-20 years from 1940) [6]
+ Number of Units (1, 2, 3-4, 5-9, etc.) [10]
+ Primary Heating Fuel (Electric, Gas, Solar, Wood, etc.) [9]

For each combination we have the average annual:  

+ Income
+ Electricity, Gas, & Other Fuel Spending

5,400 types of home *per census tract*  
~400 million cohorts (most with 0 households)  
~60 GB of data

# Simplified Cohort Attributes

Simplify:

+ Census Tract [~70,000]
+ Income Bracket (high/medium/low compared to AMI or above/below FPL) [2-3]
+ Housing Tenure (Rent / Own) [2]
+ ~~Building Age (increments of 10-20 years from 1939) [6]~~
+ Number of Units (Single vs. Multi-family) [2]
+ Primary Heating Fuel (Electric, Gas, Solar, Other) [4 - optional]

8-48 types of home  
~0.5-5 million cohorts  
~1 GB of data

# Methods

Tasks

+ Aggregate state data into a national dataset
+ Merge LEAD and REPLICA
+ Incorporate EPA eGRID and other supplemental data

+ Performed for 2018 (most recent year of data available)

Infrastructure

+ Reproducible Research
    + Uses The R Project for Statistical Computing
    + Code is fully open source (GNU Affero GPL v3.0)
    + https://github.com/ericscheier/net_energy_equity
+ AWS m4.4xlarge EC2 instance

    + Linux Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa)

# Energy Burden & Net Energy Return

\[
G_{income} = Gross\ Income
\]

\[
S_{energy} = Spending\ on\ Energy
\]

\[
Energy\ Burden = \frac{S_{energy}}{G_{income}}
\]
**"Energy poverty: spend >10% of income on energy."**
\[
Net\ Energy\ Return = \frac{G_{income} - S_{energy}}{S_{energy}}
\]
**"Energy poverty: earn <$9 for every \$1 spent on energy."**

# Why Net?

```

# Summary

```{r load-table, include=FALSE}
print_table <- read_csv("comparison_table.csv")
```


```{r table, results="asis"}
print_table %>%  knitr::kable(booktabs=T, ) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options="scale_down")
  #kableExtra::kable_styling(latex_options = c("striped","hold_position"))

# Geography

# Household Breakdowns

# State Comparison

```

# Conclusions

+ 10% of households experience energy poverty as presently defined (>10% of household income on energy expenditures)
+ 78% of households below the federal poverty line also face energy poverty
+ Fewer than 1% of those above the federal poverty line face this scarcity
+ Fossil fuel reliance does not lead to lower energy poverty rates at a state scale
+ Solar power is associated with decreased energy poverty at a household scale
+ Energy poverty presents an obstacle to decarbonization and wealth creation

# Conclusions

Energy expenditures in the US disproportionately burden those in:

+ The Black Belt across the Southeastern U.S.
+ Hispanic communities near the U.S.-Mexico border
+ Native American lands
+ The rural Northeast
+ Urban Centers

The United States should develop and implement a federal energy poverty line.

# Future Research

+ Include additional demographic and techno-economic data found in the REPLICA Dataset
+ Focus on certain jurisdictions (zip codes, cities, counties, utilities)
+ Examine unusual outcomes (e.g. 20% of those below poverty line who are not in energy poverty)
+ Formally compare different metrics to identify which are suited for what purposes
